## About the Project  
**Student Housing BV** is a **WinForms-based desktop application** developed during my first semester at **Fontys University** as part of a group project. The application serves as a comprehensive housing management system, designed to streamline communication and task management between **students** and **administrators** within shared accommodation spaces.

This project features user authentication, event management, chore tracking, issue reporting, and administrative controls to manage user access and housing-related issues.

## Key Features

- **Chore Assignment**: Organize and assign household chores to tenants.  
- **Issue Reporting**: Submit, track, and resolve accommodation-related issues.  
- **Admin Controls**:  
  - Manage users (e.g., create, ban, or modify user roles).  
  - Handle reported issues and resolve them promptly.  
  - Create new user accounts and ensure system security.  

## Technologies Used  
- **C# WinForms**: The primary framework used for building the user interface and application logic.  
- **SQL Database**: Designed for efficient data storage, including user details, housing information, and event records.  
- **GitLab**: Version control platform used for collaboration and project management.
